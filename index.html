Learn, Collaborate & Dockerize! Meet other developers and ops engineers in your community that are using and learning about Docker. Docker is an open platform that helps you build, ship and run applications anytime and anywhere. Developers use Docker to modify code and to streamline application development, while operations gain support to quickly and flexibly respond to their changing needs. Docker ensures agility, portability and control for all your distributed apps. 

Docker is also the main sponsor of the Moby Project, an open framework to assemble specialized container systems without reinventing the wheel. More information available at <a href="http://mobyproject.org/">Moby Project</a>
